NPM801 U-Boot

Installation to an SD card:
  Repartition your card with an MBR such that the first partition starts at an
  offset of no less than 270KB. Then install U-Boot image to the card like so:

    dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sdX obs=1K seek=14
    sync

  U-Boot SPL has to be burned to NAND using ingenic-bootloader-updater, which is
  present in NPM801 Android device project.
